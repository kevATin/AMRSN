#2 Team Bot Escort (TBE)  
Type: symmetric teams, time based
Potential Map Theme: Sheep herders  
Map Design: Each side gets a cage for bots and a special powerup that causes the bots to move (using biells push mechanic?) towards a dedicated goal cage usually located on the opposing side of the map. The bots are on the lowest difficulty level.  
Depending on the map size, more bots spawn in your cage over time, so teams can strategize when to release their herd and when to wait- fewer bots are easier to defend but give less points.  
Each sucessfully escorted bot gives 1 point. The team with more points when the time runs out wins. A bot that dies on the way to the goal gives no points.
