# List of ideas for simple client side Altitude mods

1. Allow selecting text in chat; to make copy and paste work.
2. Longer chat history
3. Taller chat box, based on resolution
4. Unlock all 5 additional Plane Presets, possible?
5. Select the Ace Badge you want to wear; might require separate server for coordination?
6. Small Speechbubble icon on player's who are writing in chat; next to friend and mute icons; also works for spectating players, requires server support
7. Ability to contact servers directly without nimbly main server? (LAN servers!?, testing required)
8. Remove bouncy walls from server list display and filter and in-game tablist (I just hate that setting, make your walls bouncy via the map editor directly)
9. Allow receiving and displaying custom gamemode names in the serverlist; regardless of map name
10. Mute certain (all?) server messages like gravity change, etc
11.
